# Maze-SimpleRobot
this is from the “Kickoff” section of the Beginning iOS Development nano degree from Udacity.

In this course they introduced the creation of a project in X Code, 
and provided starter code for moving a robot around a maze structure
with the goal of reaching a star location in the maze.

The student is introduced through this project to the concept of algorithms (or recipes)
The less steps in a concise instruction list makes an algorithm more efficient or "better"
